# University Projects

This repository’s main goal is to give a basic and intermediate method on how to develop a project with the next steps:

1. EDA different methods for data analysis and pattern recognition
2. Data preprocessing by using several libraries such as Numpy, Regex, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.
3. AI model development (Mostly conducted by TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn)
4. AI model result analysis and “best model” selection procedures.

Choose one of the jupyter notebooks to follow along. More detailed information about data and other processes is explained in each jupyter notebook.
